# InsureHealth@Scale

The analysis of medical insurance data of different states, age groups, and insurance providers can provide us with indicators that can help people make informed decisions to choose an optimal insurance plan. The purpose of this project is to prototype the analysis on scalable infrastructure (PySpark cluster) in preperation for when the data inevitably becomes "Big". 

The analytics performed includes identifying -

1. How plan rates affect people from different demographics
2. Relationship between plan rates and plan benefits
3. Effect of health habits and age of a person on the plan rates
4. Distribution of plans across the insurance providers

Augmenting the results from the above analsyes we build a machine learning model (using PySpark MLlibs Linear Regression Model) to predict the best plan for a given individual.
